# Quadrotor-UAV
The code involves the analysis of a PID controller system applied to a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), serving as an experimental platform for control system structural analysis and controller design.
# Model Description
The quadrotor UAV utilizes four symmetrically placed motors to regulate the speed of its propellers, thereby controlling lift and the aircraft's spatial orientation. Specifically, the aircraft's position is determined by three Euler angles: roll, pitch, and yaw, while its location involves height (throttle) and horizontal positions (x and y).
